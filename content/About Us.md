## Hello üëãüèΩ ‚Äî thank you for stopping by!

Welcome to BaseScript, an open-source software development database founded by an aspiring engineer studying at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/)! I'm Maheer, and I am the founder of this project, inspired by my friend Shadi, who came up with the idea. Find more information about us by checking out our LinkedIns!

## What is BaseScript?

At BaseScript, we're dedicated to building a comprehensive programming language database that serves as a bridge between learning and teaching. As we grow, our goal is to become the go-to resource for programmers of all levels, from beginners to experienced developers.

**What We Offer**

- <ins>Extensive Database</ins>: Our database will be inclusive of layered information regarding various programming languages, covering syntax, use cases, and practices
- <ins>Learning Resources</ins>: We provide tutorials, guides, and examples to help you understand difficult concepts with ease
- <ins>Teaching Insights</ins>: Our content is crafted by passionate students who are eager to expand their programming knowledge. Because we are constantly learning and staying current with industry trends, we understand what skills and knowledge are most important. This ensures that we will provide resources that are always up-to-date and relevant to the current market

## Format

We will be using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to create our lessons. The majority of lessons found here will abide to the following structure:

1. A brief introduction to the topic of interest
2. An in-depth explanation with examples
3. A LeetCode/HackerRank Problem

## What Does the Future Look Like?

As we continue to grow, we plan to expand our database to include more programming languages and resources. Currently, our platform specializes in the fundamentals of JavaScript and its prominent frameworks. As our individual developers (just a few of us for now :p) expand their knowledge, our goal is to document each step of the way here on BaseScript.

## Why?

You may ask, <i>"why create yet another programming database amongst all the others?"</i>. To put it simply, I felt that this was a strong opportunity to not only motivate myself, but others to learn and teach programming. I believe that the best way to learn <i>is</i> to teach, and so I thought, <i>"why not start something that involves both?"</i>. I hope that BaseScript can be a resource for you, and that you can find something of value here. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me (refer to the contact section below).

## Feedback

If you have any feedback, please feel free to <a href="mailto:maheerhuq96@gmail.com">email</a> me, or reach out to me on my socials. I am currently working on implementing a comment section feature into the website, which hopefully will be fully functional in the coming weeks.
